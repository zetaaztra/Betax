Tradyxa AegisMatrix — Unified NIFTY Options Intelligence System
Tabs: Direction · Option Sellers · Option Buyers

I’ll give you:

How the tabs are structured in UI.

What tiles go in each tab (with graphs/gauges).

How dark / light themes apply consistently.

How JSON is shared across all three.

1. High-Level UX Structure

Global frame (same for all tabs):

Header:

Product name + subtitle.

Tabs: Direction | Option Sellers | Option Buyers.

Theme toggle (dark/light).

Hard Refresh button.

Background:

AegisMatrix concentric “radar” animation.

Main content:

Tiles grid for the active tab.

Bottom:

“How to Use This Dashboard” collapsible.

Footer with all legal text and links.

Overlays:

Disclaimer modal (educational use).

Cookie & Ad consent.

Tabs are front-end only routing – you don’t hit different JSON; all 3 tabs read from the same aegismatrix.json.

2. JSON Layout (Single File, Three Logical Sections)

/public/data/aegismatrix.json (conceptual):

{
  "generated_at": "2025-11-21T10:20:00+05:30",
  "market": {
    "spot": 19783.45,
    "spot_change": 45.2,
    "vix": 15.4,
    "vix_change": -0.8,
    "regime": "LOW_VOL_BULL"
  },
  "direction": {
    "today": { ... },
    "horizons": {
      "t1": { ... },
      "t3": { ... },
      "t5": { ... },
      "t10": { ... },
      "t20": { ... },
      "t40": { ... }
    },
    "risk_score": 0.37
  },
  "seller": {
    "safe_range": { ... },
    "max_pain": { ... },
    "trap": { ... },
    "skew": { ... },
    "expiry_stress": { ... },
    "breach_probabilities": [ ... ]
  },
  "buyer": {
    "breakout_today": { ... },
    "breakout_next": [ ... ],
    "spike_direction_bias": { ... },
    "gamma_windows": [ ... ],
    "theta_edge": { ... },
    "regime": "TREND_FOLLOWING"
  }
}


Each tab just reads its slice (direction, seller, buyer) plus the shared market.

3. Tab 1 — Direction (AegisCore View)
Purpose

Sellers’ Help Tile

On click, opens modal:

Explains safe range, traps, skew, and what “expiry stress” means in plain trading terms.

Seller Color Semantics

Core seller safety = lime/safety green (#00EA99 / #1FA378).

Danger = red (#FF4E68 / #D62839).

Neutral / no signal = cold grey-blue.

5. Tab 3 — Option Buyers (PulseWave View)

No “buy now” wording.

Row 4
10. Spot Price (for buyers).

VIX / Shock Risk

Emphasis: “Shock potential” or “Gap risk” tile.

Buyers’ Help Tile

On click, opens modal that explains:

Breakout score, spike direction bar, gamma windows, theta vs edge in plain terms.

Buyer Color Semantics

Core buyer edge / spike potential = cyan (#2BDFFF / #0894C9).

Theta pain / bad days = muted grey / amber.

Spike direction uses green/red but intensity reflects conviction.

6. Themes & Backgrounds Applied to Tabs

All three tabs share:

Dark Mode:

Background: #081015

Tiles: #0E141C

Grid lines: #172029

Concentric rings: subtle rgba(43, 223, 255, 0.05) and rgba(0, 234, 153, 0.05).

Light Mode:

Background: #F7FBFE

Tiles: #FFFFFF

Grid lines: #D7DFE8

Concentric rings: rgba(8, 148, 201, 0.05).

Only accent colors differ in each tab emphasis:

Direction tab: balanced green/red + neutral grey.

Sellers tab: safety green emphasis + red warnings.

Buyers tab: cyan spike emphasis + red/green for directional skew.

7. Component Layout (Next.js App Router)

Minimal structure to reflect tabs (not full code):

/aegismatrix-ui/app
  layout.tsx        # theme, modals, cookie bar, footer
  page.tsx          # default to Direction tab
  direction/page.tsx
  sellers/page.tsx
  buyers/page.tsx


Or single-page tabbed:

// app/page.tsx
export default function Dashboard() {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<"direction"|"seller"|"buyer">("direction");
  const data = useAegisMatrixData(); // load aegismatrix.json

  return (
    <Shell>
      <TabBar ... />
      {activeTab === "direction" && <DirectionView data={data} />}
      {activeTab === "seller" && <SellerView data={data} />}
      {activeTab === "buyer" && <BuyerView data={data} />}
    </Shell>
  );
}


Either approach is fine; tabbed in a single page is simpler and faster.
